    'The initial description omitted specific numerical details such as the total number of units, the exact square footage range, and the per square foot price primarily because those details were not explicitly provided in the initial project brief shared by you. The description focused on capturing the core selling points, location, developer credentials, lifestyle, and investment potential to appeal broadly without overly technical specifics. However, based on researched data for Codename: Elements of Life: The project comprises around 130 units. Residence sizes range approximately from 1806 to 1825 sq.ft. The price is about ₹9000 per sq.ft. Including these details creates a more precise and market-relevant description, especially for clients looking for exact specs and pricing, which are critical for decision-making in premium projects. The omission was not intentional but a result of summarizing the broader project narrative. With these details, a more complete, factually anchored profile can be provided, which enhances buyer clarity and confidence. If needed, the description can be revised to explicitly include: "Featuring approximately 130 luxury 3-bedroom residences ranging 1806 to 1825 sq.ft, priced competitively at around ₹9000 per sq.ft." This would bring the description to a fuller representation aligned with your expectations and market norms for high-end villa projects in Whitefield.',
