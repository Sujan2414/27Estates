    'The initial description omitted specific numerical details such as the total number of units, the exact square footage range, and the per square foot price primarily because those details were not explicitly provided in the initial project brief shared by you. The description focused on capturing the core selling points, location, developer credentials, lifestyle, and investment potential to appeal broadly without overly technical specifics.

However, based on researched data for Codename: Elements of Life:

The project comprises around 130 units.

Residence sizes range approximately from 1806 to 1825 sq.ft.

The price is about ₹9000 per sq.ft.

Including these details creates a more precise and market-relevant description, especially for clients looking for exact specs and pricing, which are critical for decision-making in premium projects. The omission was not intentional but a result of summarizing the broader project narrative. With these details, a more complete, factually anchored profile can be provided, which enhances buyer clarity and confidence.

If needed, the description can be revised to explicitly include:

"Featuring approximately 130 luxury 3-bedroom residences ranging 1806 to 1825 sq.ft, priced competitively at around ₹9000 per sq.ft."

    'Provident Deansgate  Phase 3 (1929 Sq.Ft. to 2179 Sq.Ft.)  - 2.50 Cr onwards',
    'Provident Deansgate, located on IVC Road in North Bengaluru, is an exquisite residential development inspired by the English lifestyle, especially the charm of Manchester. Spread across a vast 15-acre gated community, it features 288 exclusive 3 BHK villaments that blend luxury with nature. These uniquely designed homes offer two types: simplex townhouses with private gardens and duplex townhouses with private terraces, ranging in size from approximately 1,900 to 2,200 sq ft. The project masterfully re-creates the ambiance of English life through red-brick architecture, vintage-style lampposts, cobblestone pathways, picket fences, and elegant garden sculptures, lending it an unparalleled charm and character.

Launched in late 2023, Provident Deansgate aims to offer a modern, sustainable community with around 80% open green spaces, which includes expansive gardens, jogging tracks, and parks. The homes are constructed with high-quality materials and incorporate seismic zone compliance—ensuring safety and robustness. Interiors feature large vitrified tiles, granite flooring in select areas, and premium ceramic finishes in wet areas. The community houses a 12,000 sq ft clubhouse equipped with a gym, swimming pool, sports courts, indoor games, multipurpose party areas, health center, and dedicated kids'' play zones, all designed to foster a vibrant and active lifestyle.

Provident Deansgate is strategically located just 15 minutes from Kempegowda International Airport and offers excellent connectivity to major IT parks and business hubs in North Bangalore. Renowned schools, healthcare facilities, retail outlets, and highways like NH44 are easily accessible, making this location ideal for discerning buyers seeking both convenience and calm. The project is RERA approved and is planned for completion and possession by May to September 2027, with Phase 3 details including simplex and duplex units priced between ₹2.40 crore to ₹2.50 crore all-inclusive.

    '✨ NBR Golden Valley – Where Nature Meets Luxury ✨

Nestled along the scenic Hosur–Bagalur Road, NBR Golden Valley is a grand 32-acre gated villa plots community that redefines refined living in Bangalore’s fast-growing suburban corridor. Developed by NBR Group, this meticulously planned estate embodies tranquility, luxury, and enduring value — offering residents a perfect blend of nature’s serenity and urban sophistication.

The project offers 325 villa plots starting from 1500 sq.ft onwards, priced attractively from ₹1,799 per sq.ft, making it an ideal investment for discerning buyers and families seeking premium yet affordable living. Surrounded by lush landscapes, mini forests, and parks blooming with exotic flora, Golden Valley presents an environment that nurtures both body and soul.

Strategically located, the project ensures seamless connectivity — just 15 minutes from the proposed Sarjapur Metro Station, 12 minutes from Hosur IT Park, 35 minutes from Wipro SEZ, and 45 minutes from Electronic City. Its proximity to key IT corridors, educational hubs, and commercial zones ensures that convenience complements every aspect of life here. The upcoming Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) will further enhance connectivity across major Bengaluru destinations, promising immense future appreciation.

Approved by HNTDA, NBR Golden Valley features wide asphalted roads, underground cabling, stormwater drains, water lines, and street lighting, reflecting world-class infrastructure. Residents enjoy premium amenities such as landscaped gardens, jogging tracks, a children’s play area, and community zones designed for leisure and togetherness.

    'White Lotus – Home of Sanctuaries',
    'White Lotus – Home of Sanctuaries is a thoughtfully crafted luxury villa development located along the serene IVC Road in North Bengaluru. Spread across 14 acres with just 95 homes (≈7 homes per acre), this low-density community is designed as a haven where residents can reconnect with nature without compromising on modern luxury.

The master plan integrates 75% open space, landscaped gardens, pocket parks, and a rejuvenated stream and lagoon (subject to approvals), creating a lush green environment where the sound of birds and the cool breeze replace urban noise. The development philosophy, called Karang Jalananda, draws from Balinese traditions, focusing on creating a personal oasis that brings natural ventilation, water features, and harmony into everyday life.

Each home sits on a ~2,400 sq. ft. plot with a ~4,000 sq. ft. SBA, and every villa offers a unique view and layout. Two villa typologies are available:

Above Abode – Sanctuary in the Sky: Elevated decks of over 400 sq. ft., recreation rooms, skylit bathrooms, and large terraces that overlook gardens, perfect for those seeking a social yet private lifestyle.

Terra Firma – Sanctuary in the Soil: Grounded layouts with ~600 sq. ft. lawns, extended family areas, and spacious decks, ideal for those who cherish tradition and multigenerational living.

At the heart of the community lies a 25,000 sq. ft. clubhouse, offering a curated mix of leisure, wellness, and social spaces: indoor/outdoor gym, yoga deck, spa, banquet hall, café, co-working spaces, kids’ pool, mini theatre, supermarket, and sports facilities including tennis, badminton, pickleball, basketball, mini golf, and cricket nets.

Every detail at Micropolis is crafted for harmony — from its 77% open spaces to lush landscaped greens, tree-lined avenues, and outdoor social zones that encourage community living. The project features 5 elegant towers per phase with large-format homes ranging from 1,900 to 2,476 sq.ft. Each residence showcases seamless indoor-outdoor integration with iconic balconies up to 170 sq.ft, large living areas, walk-in wardrobes, and premium finishes including walnut wooden flooring, elegant stone balconies, and brick-finish façades.

Highlights include temperature-controlled pools, bowling alley, squash and badminton courts, gym, yoga studio, futsal, padel tennis, multipurpose hall, outdoor workstations, amphitheatre, and a dedicated crèche and pet park.

Micropolis also embraces sustainability through eco-smart design — rainwater harvesting, zero-waste management, renewable energy use, and abundant green cover ensure a truly “carbon-healing” lifestyle.
